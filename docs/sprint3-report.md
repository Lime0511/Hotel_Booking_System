# Sprint 3 Report

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented booking notifications (e.g., confirmation emails)

- Added reporting features for admin (viewing/exporting bookings, usage)

- Finalized all UI/UX design adjustments and interface polish

- Conducted comprehensive end-to-end system testing

- Fixed remaining bugs and optimized overall system performance

## Adjustments Made
- A formal “feature freeze” mid-sprint prevented last-minute requests from derailing testing and documentation. Final feedback was solicited from stakeholders and acted on rapidly, requiring a series of quick iteration loops. The team also established a clear separation between end-user and admin acceptance criteria for final checks. Some documentation and retro activities, initially in progress, were completed in tandem with final submission.

## Reflection on Sprint Success
- This final sprint saw all project modules completed, integrated, and rigorously tested. Key challenges—such as the need to juggle last-minute bug fixes against documentation—were handled by strict division of labor and peer reviews. The team not only delivered all project goals but also improved its overall workflow and project archival process. The biggest lesson was the value of starting documentation earlier and maintaining a review mindset throughout project delivery, not just at the end.
