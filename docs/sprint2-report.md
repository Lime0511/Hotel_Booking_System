# Sprint 2 Report

## Tasks Completed
- Reviewed and refined the product backlog based on Sprint 1 feedback

- Implemented core features for searching and displaying available rooms

- Enabled users to make, modify, and cancel bookings

- Integrated a calendar system for room availability management

- Started building the admin dashboard (with view/add/edit/delete for rooms)

## Adjustments Made
- During the sprint, complexities in room availability and booking overlaps emerged. The team had to allocate additional resources to intensive integration and bug-fixing around the booking calendar, temporarily reassigning a team member from UI to backend debugging. Some documentation, sprint retrospective, and admin management functions were marked “To Do” and shifted to the next sprint due to time constraints. We planned for and added extra buffer for more thorough reviews in Sprint 3.

## Reflection on Sprint Success
- Sprint 2 expanded the project’s functional scope: not only are booking flows and room listing live, but the admin dashboard is in an advanced state. The sprint revealed our improved adaptation to daily stand-ups and rapid bug solving, yet highlighted a continued need for explicit task handoff and documentation discipline. Going forward, team reviews and documentation will run in parallel with coding to maintain knowledge transfer and project traceability.
