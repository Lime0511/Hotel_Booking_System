# Sprint 1 Report

## Tasks Completed
- Formed the project team

- Read and understood the project brief

- Brainstormed all key system ideas

- Finalised system concept: HOTEL SYSTEM

## Assigned Scrum roles

- Designed initial system architecture and drafted database schema

- Implemented user registration and login (authentication module)

## Adjustments Made
- Mid-sprint, the team prioritized critical backend/setup tasks (registration, login) over non-essential UI and validation work, which was pushed to future sprints. Some initial “To Do” tasks—like building UI layout, setting up complete project folder structures in GitHub, and developing a question/answer system—were deferred as we recognised these would depend on foundational system components first being in place.

## Reflection on Sprint Success
- Sprint 1 was a success in terms of team set-up and technical foundations: by focusing on our authentication module and clear roles, we delivered tangible progress visible in our "Done" list. The main lesson learned was the need for clearer daily progress checks and a more incremental approach to establishing both backend and frontend elements together rather than in isolation. For the next sprint, we are planning to conduct daily Scrums and be more rigorous about checkpointing our progress and revisiting our backlog regularly.
